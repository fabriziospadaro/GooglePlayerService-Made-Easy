but creating a powerfull multiplayer system is hard and time consuming.

That's why I want to share with you this cool project.

Done..

After you configure the plugin with your google play app(follow the guide on the github page i linked above), you can start making a multiplayer game using all the cool feature this project offers you such as:

-RPC(Remote procedural call)
